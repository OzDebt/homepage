                            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States
                                (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
                                and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

                            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’
                                consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>

                            <h2 id="fair-information-practices">Fair Information Practices</h2>

                            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding
                                the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

                            <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email • Other Within 1 year We will notify the users via in-site notification
                                • Other Within 1 year</p>

                            <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
                                not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

                                for violations.</p>

                            <p>We collect your email address in order to: • Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions • Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders. • Send you additional information

                            <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following: • Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses. • Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way. • Include the physical address of our

                                        information. • A debtor’s personal information may be regulated by the Privacy Act in a number of ways. • Personal information means information or an opinion, whether it is true or not, about an individual that

                            <p>Information handling by private sector organisations is regulated, in part, by the Australian Privacy Principles (the APPs).24 There are several key obligations around handling personal information: • Personal information (other

                                collect information that is reasonably necessary to recover the debt. For example, do not write down extra information about the debtor from an identifying document just because it might be useful. • Sensitive information
                                must not be collected about an individual unless the individual has consented and the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of your organisation’s functions or activities. Some limited exceptions to this rule
                                apply. Sensitive information includes information or an opinion about an individual’s race or religious beliefs, criminal record, health information, or membership of a professional or trade association. • Personal information
                                must be collected only by lawful and fair means and must be collected directly from the debtor, unless this is unreasonable or impracticable.25 • When the debtor’s information is collected, whether from a creditor or from
                                the debtor, take reasonable steps to let the debtor know: • the identity of the organisation collecting the information and how to contact it • the fact that the organisation has collected information and the circumstances
                                of that collection • the purposes for which the information is collected • the main consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the information is not provided • any law that requires the particular information
                                to be collected • the organisations (or types of organisations) to which the organisation usually discloses information of that kind • whether the organisation is likely to disclose the information to overseas recipients
                                • the fact that the debtor may access the information collected • how the individual can complain about a breach of the APPs.26 • Do not use or disclose the information for a purpose other than that for which it was collected
                                unless the debtor has consented to that use or disclosure or another exception applies.27 • Do not use or disclose personal information for direct marketing, unless certain matters are satisfied.28 • Before disclosing personal
                                information about a debtor to an overseas recipient, the collector must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the APPs in relation to that information.29
                                • Caution should be exercised when leaving messages for the debtor that may be seen or accessed by third parties, for example: • business cards or other documentation should not be left for the debtor in any open manner
                                that would allow a third party to infer the nature of your interest in contacting the debtor • voicemail messages should be phrased so as to avoid a third party inferring the nature of your interest in contacting the debtor
                                • at no stage should contact be made by a debtor’s social media account that would compromise the debtor’s privacy, for example, placing a message for the debtor in a way that would allow anyone other than the debtor to
                                view it.</p>

                            • Collectors also have privacy obligations to third parties who they collect personal information from. Under APP 3, the personal information of third parties may only be collected if this is reasonably necessary for one or more functions or activities of the collector. Third parties must also be advised if their personal information is collected.
                            • Obligations regarding consumer credit reports
                            • Part IIIA of the Privacy Act also regulates the handling of personal information contained in consumer credit reports.33 Credit providers should take care what information from a credit report is made available to you to recover a debt and ensure that defaults are only listed if the information is correct. For example, a credit provider should not disclose to an externally contracted debt collector a credit report or any information from a credit report apart from:
                            • details about the debt to be collected
                            • information that is reasonably necessary in order to identify the individual. In certain circumstances, this may include the name and addresses of the debtor
                            • any court judgments or bankruptcy orders against the debtor
                            • personal insolvency information about the debtor
